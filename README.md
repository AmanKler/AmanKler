Enthusiastic and results-driven professional with a diverse background in economics, data analysis, and research. Passionate about the transformative power of data-driven insights, I recently completed an Advanced Certificate in Market Research from Republic Polytechnic and an Associate Data Analyst certification from NTUC LearningHub.
