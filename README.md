## About
I'm an enthusiastic and results-driven research analyst with a background in Economics. I am passionate about the transformative power of data-driven insights and have recently completed an Advanced Certificate in Market Research from Republic Polytechnic as well as an Associate Data Analyst certification from NTUC LearningHub. I am now honing my skills in data analytics through projects that showcase my ability to derive meaningful insights from data.

I have experience in using tools like Power BI, Python, R, and Tableau and seek to leverage these tools to analyze data and create visualizations to explore trends and solve real-world challenges.

I am currently open to new and stimulating opportunities in research and analysis. I invite you to connect with me via email at kleramansingh@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amankler/).
